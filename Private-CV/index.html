				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Johan Wänglöf and I'm 26 years old. I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.liu.se/?l=en" target="_blank">Linköping University</a>, <i>LiU</i>, in a 'programming education (need to change this!)' called <i>Innovativ Programmering</i> <span class="refLinks">[<a href="http://www.liu.se/utbildning/program/innovativprog?l=sv" target="_blank">homepage</a>][<a href="#innovativProgrammering">anchor</a>]</span> which can be translated to 'Innovative Programming'. I'm on my second year out of three and the main focus in my education is programming. Before I began at LiU I had taught myself PHP and MySQL which I used a lot before I began. I don't use it now because I feel that I want to learn new technologies and methods, and also because school, and school related activites, takes a lot of time so there isn't really any time for some side projects. However, after a couple of courses that included web design I know that I really like working with the web and would like to continue this after graduation.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not studying I'm involved in a lot of other school activities. At LiU each major faculty have it's own organization with it's own board and members. I'm on my
