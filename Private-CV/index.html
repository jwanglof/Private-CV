				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Johan Wänglöf and I'm 26 years old. I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.liu.se/?l=en" target="_blank">Linköping University</a>, <i>LiU</i>, in a <b>'programming education (need to change this!)'</b> called <i>Innovativ Programmering</i> <span class="refLinks">[<a href="http://www.liu.se/utbildning/program/innovativprog?l=sv" target="_blank">homepage</a>][<a href="#innovativProgrammering">anchor</a>]</span> which can be translated to 'Innovative Programming'. I'm on my second year out of three and the main focus in my education is programming. Before I began at LiU I had taught myself PHP and MySQL which I used a lot before I began. I don't use it now because I feel that I want to learn new languages and methods, and also because school, and school related activites, takes a lot of time so there isn't really any time for some side projects. However, after a couple of courses that included web design I know that I really like working with the web and would like to continue this after graduation.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not studying I'm involved in a lot of other school activities. At LiU, each major faculty have it's own organization with it's own board and members. My main role on my faculty's board is as webmaster, me and a friend had plans on doing a new website but a lot of things came up so we decided to put those plans on ice for the time being.
					<br />
					I'm also part of a committee that are called <i>Festerier</i> which can be loosly described as 'a group that makes the time at school more fun than just studying'. For example, we arrange parties for >800 people once in a while, we have member nights where we do different things and some other minor things.
					<br />
					I really like being 'after-school' active since I get to meet new people from very different backgrounds, and that have very different goals in life which I think is very important because if you need advice in a matter I always have someone that can give a good advice, or just answer a question I have.
