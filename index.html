				<h1>Hello!</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Johan Wänglöf and I'm 26 years old. I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.liu.se/?l=en" target="_blank">Linköping University</a>, <i>LiU</i>, in an education that's called <i>Innovativ Programmering</i> <span class="refLinks">[<a href="http://www.liu.se/utbildning/program/innovativprog?l=sv" target="_blank">homepage</a>][<a href="#innovativProgrammering">anchor</a>]</span> which can be translated to 'Innovative Programming' for a bachelor's degree in software development. I'm on my second year out of three. Before I began at LiU I had taught myself PHP and MySQL which I used a lot before I got accepted to LiU. I don't use it now because I feel that I want to learn new languages and methods, and also because school, and school related activites, takes a lot of time so there isn't really any for some side projects. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not studying I'm involved in a lot of other school activities. At LiU, each major faculty have it's own organization with it's own board and members. My main role on my faculty's board is as webmaster, me and a friend had plans on doing a new website but a lot of things came up so we decided to put those plans on ice for the time being.
					<br />
					I'm also part of a committee that are called <i>Festerier</i> which can be loosly described as 'a group that makes the time at school more fun'. For example, we arrange parties for >800 people once in a while, we have member nights where we do different things and some other minor things.
					<br />
					I really like being 'after-school' active since I get to meet new people from very different backgrounds, and that have very different goals in life which I think is very important because if you need advice in a matter I always have someone that can give a good advice, or just answer a question I have.
				</p>

					We learn how to work in small to semi-big groups (4-8 people), we learn how to maintain a good code standard with everything that comes with and a lot more that includes programming. The structure of <i>Innovativ Programmering</i>

                    As I wrote on the index-page I'm 26 years old. I am, and have been, a student for about 5 years, take a few months (I will talk a little what I have studied in a while). I think, and most of my friends, that I am a very positive person with a smile close by, which makes meeting new people a lot easier. I know what I want and strives to achieve it, if I think something is unreachable I will always try to achieve it anyway. This is because of two reasons; one is that it will make it a challenge and the reward(s) will be so much sweeter because it's out of my comfort zone, and two I never quit and wants to challenge myself with new things. I think that if a person doesn't challenge him- or herself this person won't achieve much in life.
                    <br />

				<a id="#interests" class="a_name">Interests</a>
				<p>
					A big interest of mine is, of course, software development of all kinds. My biggest interests in development, though, is software for the web. I love how the Internet has developed over the years and that it's such a big part of everyones' life and I can only imagine it will grow bigger over the years as more and more people around the world get a high-speed internet connection and/or a smartphone. We've had a couple of web design classes and I find it really neat how much you can actually do with the web, and the impact it has on so many people.
					<br />
					Another thing I really love is working out in all kind of ways. I go to the gym regularly each week which I have done since I was in my teens. I also began running last summer which is getting more and more fun; however, it's been a couple of months since I last ran because of the flu and the really cold weather we have in Sweden from November-March. One more exercise I really like is biking, I bought a race bike this summer and used it the main part of the summer to get around instead of using public transportation or the car. I really like biking around, one because it's really fast now that I own a race bike, and two because I really love how close to the nature I am when on it.

					I haven't really developed anything impressive, but I've learned a lot of new languages. During my 1.5 years at the university I've learned: Python, Ruby, C++, Java (with Android development in focus), Assembly, JavaScript (mostly jQuery's syntax though). Since we learn so many languages in such a short amount of time we don't really have time to get advanced in any languages but we do, however, get a good overview how each language work, and we really learn how to find answers to many of the troubles we have during the course.
					<br />
					My favorite language so far is Python, but I'm starting to like Java as well.
